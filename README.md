## Changing the Text on the title page

- In Github.com navigate to the main page of your repository
- Open the /docs folder, then click on index.html

- The same way you can change all text in the index.html file, that appears on the website. Just search for the text, change and commit it. But beware: Don't change accidently something that involves < > signs, until you know what you are doing.
